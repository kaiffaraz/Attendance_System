Attendance System (Face Recognition Based)

📖 Overview

The Attendance System is a Python-based project that uses Face Recognition and Computer Vision to automate attendance marking.
Instead of maintaining manual registers, this system recognizes faces in real time, records attendance automatically, and generates useful insights.

✨ Features

👤 Face Registration → Add new members by capturing their face images.

🎥 Real-time Recognition → Detect and identify faces from webcam or uploaded images.
